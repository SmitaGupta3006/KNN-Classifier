# KNN Classifier
Classification using KNN on Vertebral Column Data Set.

About the dataset: This Biomedical data set was built by Dr. Henrique da Mota during a medical residence period in Lyon, France. Each patient in the data set is represented in the data set by six biomechanical attributes derived from the shape and orientation of the pelvis and lumbar spine (in this order): pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, lumbar lordosis angle, sacral slope, pelvic radius and grade of spondylolisthesis. The following convention is used for the class labels: DH (Disk Hernia), Spondylolisthesis (SL), Normal (NO) and Abnormal (AB).

Tools Used: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Sk-learn, Matplotlib, Math
